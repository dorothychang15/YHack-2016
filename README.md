## Synopsis

Our project begun with the vision of visualizing data from the world bank to for comparative analysis between countries with regards to economic metrics like population, GDP, etc. We've approached this in Unity through three visualizations: a bar graph, a globe where values protrude countries from the earth, and particles being released from the globe. 

## How to run

There are currently three scenes in unity (the visualizations described above) which can be observed by building each scene, then observing on the Disney cardboard on an Android device.
